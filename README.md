# Hacker Experience Community Management Team

Welcome to the home of the Community Management team, responsible for the well-being of the Hacker Experience community.

If you aren't already, we'd love to have you as a member of our community. See the [Community Manifesto](COMMUNITY.md) for information on how it works and how you can join it.

## Goals

The Community Management team has the following goals:

- Assess participation, environment and wishes of the community.
- Assess and optimize the contribution process.
- Proactively detect and resolve problems and flaws within the community.

For a more detailed description of these goals, as well as how we plan to achieve them and what motivates us, see [STATEMENT](STATEMENT.md).

## Status

The [status page](STATUS.md) describes what the team is working on, what is being discussed and what it needs help with. [Check it out](STATUS.md).

## Contributing

The best way you can contribute to the Community Management team is by simply being a respectful, nice person within the community. Reporting disrespectful individuals is another way. For more information, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

You might be interested on contributing to different teams within the project. For a better overview of how the contribution process works, please check the [Contributor Task Force document](CTF.md).
