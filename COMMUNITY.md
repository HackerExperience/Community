# Community Manifesto

The Hacker Experience community is a place you can meet fellow players, talk about the game or anything else in a friendly, respectful and diverse environment. It's also the place contributors can discuss and extend the game, submitting suggestions and improvements that will be handled and reviewed by other contributors and developers.

People from all around the world are invited to join the community, regardless of any personal trait or differences they might have.

We value suggestions and constructive criticism, which should be properly handled and reported as feedback, but we absolutely repudiate unsubstantiated claims, intellectual dishonesty and bad faith negativity.

## Vision

We want a community where we can:

- be ourselves, without fear of being harmed because of our differences;
- find people whom we can trust and be friends with;
- talk about everyday stuff, from meaningless things to profound philosophical reflections;
- talk about Hacker Experience, share strategies, ask questions, meet players;
- contribute to Hacker Experience, suggest features, report bugs, talk to developers.

## Code of Conduct (CoC)

Be respectful.

That's the full CoC of this community. Failure to comply with the CoC can lead to permanent exclusion of the user.

Before applying punishment measures, we will make sure to analyze the context, which is unique to each incident. Sometimes issuing a warning first is a better outcome. Other times, the mishap may have originated from a poor choosing of words, not necessarily based on bad faith. As such, each abuse report should be analyzed carefully and impartially. We give all users the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise.

## Join the Community

If you share our vision about the community, we'd love to have you as a member. All you have to do is to create an account on our [chat server](https://chat.hackerexperience.com) and start talking. That's it :)

If you want to further contribute with the project, we invite you to take a look at the [Contribution Task Force document](CTF.md), which outlines how the contribution process works.
