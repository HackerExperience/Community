# Community Management Team Statement

As a team, our main motivation is to set forth the project's vision of getting people involved on Open Source Software as first-time contributors, which is one way to achieve the project's main objective of fostering Computer Science education.

We know that only by growing and cultivating a friendly and respectful community we will be able to sustain this long-term vision. The craft of such community is not only a means to our goals but also something that motivates us. It's definitely a place we all would like to be a part of.

## Goals

Fueled by what was described above, the Community Management team's objectives include:

- Assess participation, environment and wishes of the community.
- Assess and optimize the contribution process.
- Proactively detect and resolve problems and flaws within the community.

## Plan

Note: We are still figuring this out. Do send suggestions if you've got any.
