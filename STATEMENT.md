# Community Management Team Statement

As a team, our main motivation is to set forth the project's vision of getting people involved on Open Source Software as first-time contributors, which is one way to achieve the project's main objective of fostering Computer Science education.

We know that only by growing and cultivating a friendly and respectful community we will be able to sustain this long-term vision. The craft of such community is not only a means to our goals but also something that motivates us. It's definitely a place we all would like to be a part of.

## Goals

Fueled by what was described above, the Community Management team's objectives include:

- Assess participation, environment and wishes of the community.
- Assess and optimize the contribution process.
- Proactively detect and resolve problems and flaws within the community.

## Plan

#### Assess participation, environment and wishes of the community.
This can be done by creating a way to feedback without that much effort such as the Discord suggestions page. (https://feedback.discordapp.com/forums/326712-discord-dream-land) it can help as its minimalistic to vote, etc.

#### Proactively detect and resolve problems and flaws within the community.
This can easily be done by offering rewards to users who can find genuine problems such as if they find 10 problems they get a certain perk just like the donation tiers, etc or referrals & similar things, This has already been half implemented but now we are needing a way to track the number and give perks on the activity of the user in this programme.

#### Assess and optimize the contribution process.
Give trusted members of the CTF programme access to open, close, assign(tags), remove(tags), And basically `Write Access` and they are only able to deal with `Issues` stoping any form of abuse, misconduct or similar being possible as all actions on GitHub can be revesed.
